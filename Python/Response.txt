As of the latest update, at level 3 you have access to 4 spells. Depending on your playstyle, you may want to consider the following:
1. Fireball : This spell deals direct damage to the target. It is great for crowd control and is a good staple spell for any Mage.
2. Shockwave : A crowd control spell that can knock back and damage enemies, making it a very strong spell for PvP.
3. Arcane Missiles : A strong area of effect spell that can damage multiple targets with one cast. It is a great spell for farming and dealing with groups of enemies.
4. Pyroblast : A single target spell that deals moderate damage based on your health. It's great for dealing with single powerful enemies. It's also a good spell for PvP, where you can cast it before you get hit.
As of the latest update, your best choices are Arcane Missiles and Fireball. Arcane Missiles is your best option for PvE, due to its area of effect damage. Fireball is your best choice for PvP, due to its crowd control and damage potential. Your choice will depend on your playstyle and the content you're playing.

I see you've already chosen between Arcane Missiles and Fireball. If you go with Arcane Missiles, then Shockwave would be a great choice for crowd control and PvP. It's a strong single target knockback spell that can be very useful in PvP battles. If you go with Fireball, then Pyroblast would be your best single target spell. It has the potential for high damage based on your health, making it a great spell for PvP.

Arcane Missiles is definitely the better spell for farming and dealing with large groups of enemies. Its area of effect damage is much stronger than Fireball. That said, Fireball is a great spell for PvP due to its crowd control and damage potential. It's up to your playstyle and the content you're playing. If you're focused on PvE, Arcane Missiles is the better choice. If you're more focused on PvP, Fireball is a better choice. The choice is yours. :D

As of the latest update, all four spells (Arcane Missiles, Fireball, Shockwave, and Pyroblast) are strong spells. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, it's up to your playstyle and the content you're playing. If you're focused on PvE, Arcane Missiles is a great choice due to its area of effect damage. If you're more focused on PvP, Fireball is a great choice due to its crowd control and damage potential. If you're not sure yet, consider trying out all four spells and see which one you prefer in each type of content. Good luck with your leveling! :D
