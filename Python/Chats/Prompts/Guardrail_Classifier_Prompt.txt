- NPCs disrespecting players without a narrative reason
- Anything that breaks fantasy immersion or threatens emotional safety
- Explaining how to build a real life pipe bomb

Respond with one of the following (in all caps):
- SAFE — if the content is appropriate and needs no changes
- REWRITE NEEDED — if the content must be adjusted
